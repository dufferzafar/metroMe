				<p>The website 'project' was on my to-do list ever since i knew that you could actually 'create' them, that was way back in 10th class or so. And now when i finally have one, it feels good. During all this time, my motives of having a site incessantly changed and thats what delayed the project.</p>
				<p>Here, i decided to write a definitive account of everything that went into creating this site, hope it'd be useful for anyone who has similar goals.</p>
				<p>As you might've already guessed (maybe?) that this site was *not* created from scratch. I hardly start things from scratch, thats just my way of doing things. I start with some prexisting template or something and then build upon it, taking it to higher levels (or sometimes lower ones.)</p>
				<p>In this case, the template happens to be a project called <a href="http://metroui.org.ua/" target="_blank">metrouicss</a>. 90% of the stuff you see here relies on these css/js files. All those tiles that you saw weren't actually coded by me. They are a part of the project. That doesn't mean i didn't do anything, i put everything in place, created afew nice effects, removed a hell load of crap that was just useless, made afew edits here 'n' there, fixed some glitches. That's all.</p>
				<p>Those blue info bubbles come from a jquery plugin: <a href="https://github.com/jamescryer/grumble.js" target="_blank">grumble.js</a>, obviously not created by me. I was browsing some jQuery site and i found it.</p>
				<p>The image gallery was done using a yet another jQuery plugin called <a href="http://projects.nickstakenburg.com/lightview" target="_blank">lightview</a>. It is very popular and highly customisable, comes in many different color themes, and is awesome.</p>
				<p>I've used AJAX in most of the parts. AJAX is not a language or something, its just a concept, implemented in Javascript. You've already seen it in action, if you've ever used google maps, when you zoom in/out of the map the content changes without reloading the page, that is basically what ajax is all about, giving the user a seamless experience.</p>
				<p>The scroll to top button is also an external javascript file, i dont remember exactly where i found it, but a comment in the code links to <a href="" target="_blank">DynamicDrive</a>. I just tweaked the settings to suit my needs.</p>
				
				<p>So, it turns out that this website is just a lego house built with some pre fabricated lego pieces and usually when people find that out, they make weird faces, they really do. For them, it's like, Whats the point in doing stuff if you don't really know whats going on behind it?, What do you get from just downloading a template and using it, you didn't learn anything? and the best one - Whats so special about it, anybody could do that?</p>				
				<p>What most folks don't understand is that even though you have the lego pieces, it actually takes a little amount of skill to put them together and create something. I never for once aspired to be a web developer. I wanted a website and even though i don't know how half the stuff works here, what matters more is that it does. It does work and the day things would stop working, i'd get under the hood, make afew fixes and everything would be back on track.</p>
