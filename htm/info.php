				<p>To keep it short, i am just a regular CS undergrad from jamia millia islamia. I have a profound interest in computing and everything even remotely related to it, as a consequence i happen to be a programmer. When i am not busy coding, i'd probably be busy reading blogs, books, quora, wikipedia - anything that keeps my grey cells working.</p>

				<h2>What's with "dufferzafar" ?</h2> <br />
				<p>Back in 2011, it was just a handle on some of the forums i was active on (for those who don't know what a handle is: its just a username but hackers call it a 'handle' coz it sounds cool..)</p>
				<p>Today I have the same username on almost every web service, which saves me the trouble of remembering a multitude of user-pass combos.</p>
