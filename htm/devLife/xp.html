<p>Of all the problems that ship with windows, the biggest one definitely lies in the state of the OS. It gets 'corrupted' so damn easily. You tinker some system file, install something that wasn't supposed to be and boom!. The next thing you see, is a blue screen (of death) showing a random error that caused the porblem. When you are a fifteen year old who doesn't understand what DLL files are supposed to do, the frequency of these incidents increases.</p>
